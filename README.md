Run composer, npm, bower, gulp, vagrant commands in one command, ayi make your life easier. Just type Ayi pia

Usually we need to run a lot of commands after we create a project, composer install, npm install, gulp build, vagrant up. And this will cause a lot of troubles for people who are not familiar with these tools, so we created
`Ayi` to centralize all these commands and config files, provide some default settings so you can set up a project very quickly. It's kind of like yeoman, except it's for php developers using vagrant on windows system only.

Btw: If you bother Ayi too often, she will give u a dozen.
