# How to get started with go

## Install 

http://golang.org/doc/install#download

Remember to add go to path `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`, you may need to restart
your system.

## Editor

https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins

We can just use PhpStorm for that, but you need to update to PhpStorm9, or you can
use the community edition for pycharm or even Andrioid studio

Follow the instruction to install the go plugin. ( I can't find the plugin without adding the alpha repo)
