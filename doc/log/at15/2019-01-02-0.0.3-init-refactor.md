# 2019-01-02 Init Refactor 0.3.0

Ayi's development was stopped along with go.ice around April 2018, 
my last attempt was to use Ayi to formalize the github issue label and projects across all my open source side projects and dyweb's,
which stopped after picking the color for common labels.

The rough plan for the refactor is the following:

First write the doc

- review what is the original goal for Ayi
- what does current codebase of Ayi achieved, how much are good enough to be kept during refactor
- what is the overall goal after the refactor
- what is the next doable milestone of the refactor

Second recover current features (just git clone & web static) in the refactored code base

Third add new features like homepage etc.
