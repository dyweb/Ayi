# Ayi recap

## Original goal

Ayi was started when I was back in SJTU and writing PHP, the main goal is to have a tool to setup develop environment
automatically for students that just joined the studio, [original blog](https://blog.dongyueweb.com/ayi.html) is written in 2016.
It should be able to manage project, check and install lacked dependency.
Go was chosen but I didn't know much about Go at that time, only knew it for the MIT 6.824 lab.

## Current codebase

After several refactor current code base actually only has one functionality that is `ayi git clone <arbitary-url>` 
which gives a correct clone path based on `$GOPATH` regardless where you call it.
It also has a static web server and ssh server under `ayi web`, the github integration is not usable at all.

## Refactor plan

Actually, there are not much to refactor because there is actually not much code

- the `App` interface can be simplified or merge the cli related logic into go.ice
- wait on upstream gommon update, the logger is still hard to use
- add static assets using gommon/rice (still have much to update)

## Next milestone

- switch to go.mod (make use of the replace API, need to tweak CI as well)
- cleaner interface
- make sure `git clonet` and `web static` still works
- a static html home page rendered using go template
- (optional) manage github issues in a unified pages (most recent clicked issues etc.)
- (optional) project management, multiple projects referring to each other w/ dependencies
